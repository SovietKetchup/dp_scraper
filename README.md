# What is it?

dp_scraper is a program written in Ruby to scrape all of the posts from [/r/dailyprogrammer](www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) and set them to files with re-names titles and into organised folders.

# Future Plans

* I may at some point set up some further organisation to sort the early posts (that are names *oddly* and inconsistently)
* I may also re-write the sorting block in the future but, as they say, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"

If the posting on [/r/dailyprogrammer](www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) changes format I may also consider adding features to keep the project working, if I remember that it exists by then.
