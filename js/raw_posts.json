In our case we will use f(x) = z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – 0.221 – 0.713 i, because that makes a particularly pretty picture.

That’s because, if the absolute value of an input number exceeds the threshold value, it will keep increasing or decreasing without bounds when you keep applying your function. So your program needs to keep a whole bunch of these small complex numbers in memory – one number for each pixel in your final image.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3 - Apply f to that set of complex numbers iteratively&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your program needs to check &lt;em&gt;how many times you can apply the function f to each of the complex numbers above before its absolute value crosses the threshold value&lt;/em&gt;.

The numbers in each cell are indexes (0-based) into the looper tiles `╹╺┗╻┃┏┣╸┛━┻┓┫┳╋` (leading index 0 is space)\n\n2. The 4 digit binary representation of each index indicates whether there is a tick that points `WSEN`\n\n3. Cells with a single index are forced moves.  Cells with multiple indexes are potential moves.\n\n4. The general strategy for finding all valid final (ones with single indexes per cell) grids is to repeatedly split the grid based on one multiple cell (where each grid has a unique index in that cell), and then find all forced moves in each independent grid.\n\n5. A forced move by row is one where the left cells' East tick is equal to the right cell's West tick.

Ward published a pamphlet telling of a long-lost treasure available to anyone clever enough to solve the puzzle associated with it. Ward reported that around 1817, a man named Thomas Jefferson Beale stumbled upon gold and silver deposits in what is now Colorado. Agreeing to keep it all a secret, Beale’s team had spent the better part of two years quietly mining, then had taken the metals to Virginia by wagon and buried them in a vault underground between 1819 and 1821. Beale had written three notes explaining where the treasure was and who had legal rights to shares in it, encrypting each of these using a different text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the second of the three texts was deciphered using a slightly altered version of the Declaration of Independence. Each number in the text corresponded to a word in the U.S. Declaration of Independence. The first letter of each of those words spelled the plaintext—with a few modifications for errors and spelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your mission today is to go treasure hunting and to write a program to decipher Beale&amp;#39;s message. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature&amp;#39;s god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security such has been the patient

Ward published a pamphlet telling of a long-lost treasure available to anyone clever enough to solve the puzzle associated with it. Ward reported that around 1817, a man named Thomas Jefferson Beale stumbled upon gold and silver deposits in what is now Colorado. Agreeing to keep it all a secret, Beale’s team had spent the better part of two years quietly mining, then had taken the metals to Virginia by wagon and buried them in a vault underground between 1819 and 1821. Beale had written three notes explaining where the treasure was and who had legal rights to shares in it, encrypting each of these using a different text.\n\nEventually, the second of the three texts was deciphered using a slightly altered version of the Declaration of Independence. Each number in the text corresponded to a word in the U.S. Declaration of Independence. The first letter of each of those words spelled the plaintext—with a few modifications for errors and spelling.\n\nYour mission today is to go treasure hunting and to write a program to decipher Beale's message. \n\n## DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE\n\n&gt; When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government the history of the present king of great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute

Remember - the first letter of that word number from the US Declaration of Independence. Spacing, punctuation, capitalization, and fixing spelling is left as an exercise to the treasure seeker (as Beale intended). The above letter was intended to decrypt to:\n\n*I have deposited in the county of Bedford, about four miles from Buford's, in an excavation or vault, six feet below the surface of the ground, the following articles, belonging jointly to the parties whose names are given in number \"3,\" herewith:*\n\n*The first deposit consisted of one thousand and fourteen pounds of gold, and three thousand eight hundred and twelve pounds of silver, deposited November, 1819. The second was made December, 1821, and consisted of nineteen hundred and seven pounds of gold, and twelve hundred and eighty-eight pounds of silver; also jewels, obtained in St. Louis in exchange for silver to save transportation, and valued at $13,000.*\n\n*The above is securely packed in iron pots, with iron covers. The vault is roughly lined with stone, and the vessels rest on solid stone, and are covered with others. Paper number \"1\" describes the exact locality of the vault so that no difficulty will be had in finding it.*\n\n# Notes\n\nBeale counts the first word as index \"1\", not \"0\" - a difference from most computer programming languages. Account for that.\n\nThere are 1322 words in the above Declaration of Independence. If you see a number larger than that, wrap around. \n\nThe inspiration for this challenge comes from the [Damn Interesting website](http://www.damninteresting.com/89-263-201-500-337-480/) and my love of the Nicholas Cage movie series \"National Treasure\".

Air (or any fluid) will move from high pressure zone to low pressure if there is an open pathway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a circular (donut tube) hub.  At the north end of the hub is an inlet tube that can only receive air from the high pressure tank (one way valve at the tank).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside the tubular donut are blocking metalic slugs that are controlled magnetically by up to 2 servo motors on top and bottom (in same plane as) of the donut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each servo can move an unlimited amount of slugs inside the hub, with each slug set at a fixed distance from each other, determined by magnetic attachments to the servo.  If there are 2 servos, the slugs they control may or may not interloc, but there is a restriction on combined positions, as slugs may not jump over each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The donut hub can be modeled as a straight line where coordinates wrap around from the 2 end-points.  At each integer position on the line, there may be an inlet/outlet tube with a fixed connection.  The legend for those tube states are: (# represents a digit/number)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;High Pressure&lt;/strong&gt; input.  At least 1 inlet tube at position 0.  Likely never need for additional High pressure inputs into hub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;No Port&lt;/strong&gt;.  Permanently closed no inlet or outlet at that integer location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Bypass loop&lt;/strong&gt;:  connects to another port on the hub.  The number indicates the integer position on the hub that is connected to this port.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#M&lt;/code&gt; - 3 data points:  First number is a motor id.  M indicates that this is an &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;open motor&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.  The motor exhausts to atmosphere.  An open motor is one that has (optionally) its own valves to control timing.  The generally provide &amp;quot;continuous directional force&amp;quot; &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDR40Eyuu7w\"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of valveless engine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#F#&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Feedback motor&lt;/strong&gt;.  Like an open motor but with exhaust connected back to the hub.  The extra trailing number indicates the hub port the exhaust is connected to.  The exhaust once into the hub would generally get routed to a Low Pressure outlet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#B#&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Binary motor:&lt;/strong&gt; Lead number is also motor id.  Trailing number is the actuator&amp;#39;s exhaust port connection.  A binary motor is an actuator controlled by the hub.  When its inlet port is open, its outlet port (connected to trailing number) must be closed.  This setting fills the actuator allowing it to work.  When its outlet/exhaust is open and inlet closed, the actuator relaxes (through spring).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Li&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Low Pressure inlet&lt;/strong&gt;  If present would feed low power to any motors that share its open path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Lo&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Low Pressure outlet&lt;/strong&gt;  If present, exhaust from &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt; motors would route/path into these.  When low pressure inlet is blocked, then braking to the motor is applied while filling the low pressure tank with &amp;quot;stored energy&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;i#&lt;/code&gt; - Input from exhaust of any motor.  Trailing number connects to original F or B motor input.  An extra one way valve ensures that exhaust can only flow one way from motor.  To allow reverse flow, then use a &lt;code&gt;passtrhough (#)&lt;/code&gt; port descriptor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Exhaust&lt;/strong&gt;.  If present allows any air pressure in the &amp;quot;open hub path&amp;quot; that includes the Exhaust to go to 0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;X&amp;#39; - &lt;strong&gt;Hub closure&lt;/strong&gt; - hub simplification to prevent wrap around of air back to start.  Barrier inside the hub that permanently blocks air flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;motor states&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to catalogue all possible motor states given a port layout, and a &amp;quot;slug lockring&amp;quot;.  The &lt;strong&gt;basic motor states&lt;/strong&gt; for each type:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;M off 0 - outlet is blocked&lt;br/&gt;\nM on 1 - outlet is open&lt;br/&gt;\nB off 0 - outlet is blocked  OR exhaust is open&lt;br/&gt;\nB on 1 - outlet is open AND (exhaust is closed) OR exhaust paths/routes to H.&lt;br/&gt;\nF off 0 - outlet is blocked  OR (exhaust is blocked OR no free path from exhaust to E or Lo)&lt;br/&gt;\nF on 1 - outlet is open   AND exhaust is open AND free path from exhaust to &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Lo&lt;/code&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: all motors are off if H is blocked.

Air (or any fluid) will move from high pressure zone to low pressure if there is an open pathway.\n\nThere is a circular (donut tube) hub.  At the north end of the hub is an inlet tube that can only receive air from the high pressure tank (one way valve at the tank).\n\nInside the tubular donut are blocking metalic slugs that are controlled magnetically by up to 2 servo motors on top and bottom (in same plane as) of the donut.\n\nEach servo can move an unlimited amount of slugs inside the hub, with each slug set at a fixed distance from each other, determined by magnetic attachments to the servo.  If there are 2 servos, the slugs they control may or may not interloc, but there is a restriction on combined positions, as slugs may not jump over each other.\n\nThe donut hub can be modeled as a straight line where coordinates wrap around from the 2 end-points.  At each integer position on the line, there may be an inlet/outlet tube with a fixed connection.  The legend for those tube states are: (# represents a digit/number)\n\n`H` - **High Pressure** input.  At least 1 inlet tube at position 0.  Likely never need for additional High pressure inputs into hub.\n\n`_`- **No Port**.  Permanently closed no inlet or outlet at that integer location.\n\n`#` **Bypass loop**:  connects to another port on the hub.  The number indicates the integer position on the hub that is connected to this port.\n\n`#M` - 3 data points:  First number is a motor id.  M indicates that this is an \"**open motor**\".  The motor exhausts to atmosphere.  An open motor is one that has (optionally) its own valves to control timing.  The generally provide \"continuous directional force\" [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDR40Eyuu7w) of valveless engine.\n\n`#F#` - **Feedback motor**.  Like an open motor but with exhaust connected back to the hub.  The extra trailing number indicates the hub port the exhaust is connected to.  The exhaust once into the hub would generally get routed to a Low Pressure outlet.\n\n`#B#` - **Binary motor:** Lead number is also motor id.  Trailing number is the actuator's exhaust port connection.  A binary motor is an actuator controlled by the hub.  When its inlet port is open, its outlet port (connected to trailing number) must be closed.  This setting fills the actuator allowing it to work.  When its outlet/exhaust is open and inlet closed, the actuator relaxes (through spring).\n\n`Li` - **Low Pressure inlet**  If present would feed low power to any motors that share its open path.\n\n`Lo` - **Low Pressure outlet**  If present, exhaust from `F` motors would route/path into these.  When low pressure inlet is blocked, then braking to the motor is applied while filling the low pressure tank with \"stored energy\"\n\n`i#` - Input from exhaust of any motor.  Trailing number connects to original F or B motor input.  An extra one way valve ensures that exhaust can only flow one way from motor.  To allow reverse flow, then use a `passtrhough (#)` port descriptor.\n\n`E` - **Exhaust**.  If present allows any air pressure in the \"open hub path\" that includes the Exhaust to go to 0.\n\n'X' - **Hub closure** - hub simplification to prevent wrap around of air back to start.  Barrier inside the hub that permanently blocks air flow.\n\n#motor states\nThe challenge is to catalogue all possible motor states given a port layout, and a \"slug lockring\".  The **basic motor states** for each type:\n\nM off 0 - outlet is blocked  \nM on 1 - outlet is open   \nB off 0 - outlet is blocked  OR exhaust is open   \nB on 1 - outlet is open AND (exhaust is closed) OR exhaust paths/routes to H.  \nF off 0 - outlet is blocked  OR (exhaust is blocked OR no free path from exhaust to E or Lo)  \nF on 1 - outlet is open   AND exhaust is open AND free path from exhaust to `E` or `Lo`)  \n\nNote: all motors are off if H is blocked.  F motors are off if `Lo` is blocked.  \n\n**special modes:**\n\nB hold 2: outlet closed AND (exhaust closed OR no path/route to open Lo or E).  \nB passtrhough 3:  (basic off 0).  Outlet open AND exhaust open. (this creates an open path from H to exhaust node, which would typically wreck havoc with normal routing among multiple motors)  \n\nF brake 2: ON and outlet open AND path/routed to `Lo` AND `Li` is blocked.  \nF brake hard 3: OFF AND (exhaust is blocked OR exhaust path to `Lo` is blocked)  \nF reverse 4:  H (High Pressure input) is blocked from input  AND input open and is path/routed to `E` AND exhaust is open and path/routed to `Li`  \n\n#input format\n2 (or 3) lines (with visual header)\nAligned boxes of hub index and port description at each index (visual sugar. doesn't need parsing)   \na spaced delimited list of the port description at each hub index.  \nA space delimited list of slug intervals with 0 the first index.\nAn optional additional space delimited list of slug intervals if a 2nd servo-motor is being used.\n\n\n#output format\n\nThe challenges are to rotate dials (servo settings) to every integer position to determine the motor states of all motors connected to hub at each dial setting.\n\n**basic output** (one line per dial position)  \ndial setting (2 if 2 servos), motor state of  each motor (in motorid order).
